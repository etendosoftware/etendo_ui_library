## Using the Playground to Test Components

To use the Playground for testing Etendo UI components, follow these steps:

1. **General Setup**:

   - Run `yarn install` in the `etendo_ui_library` directory.
   - Additionally, execute `yarn watch` in the root directory. This is crucial as it copies the components into the **nextjs** and **React Native** folders for a seamless integration.

     **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** When making changes to the Etendo UI library, always modify the components in the `src/components` directory. Avoid making changes in the `examples` folder components, as they are only copies and your changes won't be reflected in the library.

2. **For Mobile Testing**:

   - Navigate to `examples/ReactNative`.
   - Run `yarn install` to install necessary dependencies.
   - To test on iOS, execute `cd ios && pod install && cd .. && yarn run ios`.
   - For Android, use `yarn run android`.

3. **For Web Testing**:
   - Change directory to `examples/nextjs/apps/web`.
   - Ensure that you have Node.js version **18.17.0 or later** installed. It is worth mentioning that this is only required for this web playground, to develop the **Etendo UI** Node.js **16.10.0 or higher** is required.
   - Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
   - Start the development server with `yarn dev`.

Happy coding with Etendo UI! üöÄüéâ
